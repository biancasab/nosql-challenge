This repository contains two main files:

NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb was used for the database and jupyter notebook set up, and updating the database.

NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb was used for exploratory analysis.

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
